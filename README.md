# bayesian_projects
applied projects to practise bayesian techniques of inference and modelling
Starting ideas:
benchmarking kpis
 / forecasting future values
 / enhancing ab tests with probability scores
 / replacing significance ab tests with more agile ab tests
 / drivers of quant kpis with bayesian linear regression
